Can be used to watch many items, efficiently. Note that the first element to init's `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` and `threshold` values will be used. We use -150 on the bottom and top here so you can see the observer working without needing dev tools.

In this demo we are using `once` to unobserve once an element comes into view.
