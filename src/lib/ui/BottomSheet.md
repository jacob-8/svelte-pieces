- draggable only by touch
- `max`, `start`, and `min` are percentages from the top, so a max of 10 will let the sheet be dragged up to a height of 90%.

[[BottomSheet.composition]]

## Notes
- ~~auto-resizes to fit content, up until max or start value (whichever is the larger restriction in terms of percentage distance from top)~~ (janky on mobile, but see BottomSheet.svelte file history if ever wanting to look at the code)
- It doesn't make sense to set the start to a greater value than max.
- Press escape to close
