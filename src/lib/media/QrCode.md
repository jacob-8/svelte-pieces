# QrCode

- Use SVG so works both server and client side
- QRCode generator from https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library because it's written in Typescript and includes great comments

<Story knobs={{ value: 'kitbook.vercel.app', pixelsPerModule: 4 }} let:knobs={{ value, pixelsPerModule }}>
  <QrCode {value} {pixelsPerModule} errorCorrection="high" />
</Story>
