# Svelte Pieces

Install with `npm i -D svelte-pieces`.

Built using Kitbook, UnoCSS, and Iconify icons - you don't need UnoCSS installed for these components to work properly as the classes get generated at packaging time thanks to `@unocss/svelte-scoped`'s [preprocessor](https://unocss.dev/integrations/svelte-scoped#svelte-preprocessor).
